As of now run devClient, devServer scripts in sepearate terminals to debug and watch both server side and ui code. Only for dev debugging.
Will come up with a better solution later.

For node debugging in chrome open link chrome://inspect/#device and click on inspect or dev debug info.

DialogFlow Tips:
for names use @sys.any, given-name is not good for non english names

Revisit to edit below info on build runs, package.json etc

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
